I've wanted to use the Pomodoro Technique regularly for a while now. It's hailed as a super simple but effective timing technique to increase productivity. Every time I try to use it, however, I find that I have to prioritize my tasks before I start working. The process always ends up more complicated for me. 

That's why I wanted to make a program that builds upon the existing technique by helping me out in the areas that are keeping me from making the most of it. The program takes in information on all your tasks and gives back a list sorted by due date, difficulty, and time needed per task. This way, you can focus on actually doing your work, and don't have to spend extra time prioritizing. 

I'm using Java to improve my OOP knowledge and skills, as well as my familiarity with the language overall. I'm keeping it as a local program for now for simplicity and to test it thoroughly myself to see if it actually helps me. If I can get it to actually increase my productivity, I would love to make a web app out of it (it could definitely use a nice user interface) and deploy it for more people to use!
