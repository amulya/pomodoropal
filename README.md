I've wanted to use the Pomodoro Technique regularly for a while now. It's hailed as a super simple but effective timing technique to increase productivity. But every time I try to use it, I can never get started right away because I have to scope out my tasks first. The process just ends up more complicated for me. 

That's why I wanted to make a program that helps prioritize and organize your work before you time yourself. The program takes in information on all your tasks and gives back a list sorted by due date, difficulty, and estimated time per task. This way, you can focus on actually doing your work.

I'm using Java to improve my OOP knowledge and skills, as well as my familiarity with the language overall. I'm keeping it as a local program for now for simplicity and to see if it really helps. If I can get it to actually increase my productivity, I would love to make a web app out of it (it could definitely use a nice user interface) and deploy it for more people to use!
